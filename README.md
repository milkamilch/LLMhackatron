### What even is this? 🤷‍♀️

In short, it’s a **Python-based masterpiece** that may or may not have been fueled by equal parts genius and panic. It does *something*… well, sort of… okay, we’ll explain:

- **Backend:** Python magic (mostly `print()` statements and hope).  
- **Libraries Used:** Some cool ones like `requests`, `pandas`, and the most mysterious one of all: `time.sleep()`.  
- **AI/ML:** It’s learning… slowly… much like us during a Hackathon.  
- **Business Logic:** We’re still working on that one, but we assure you it’s *business-y*.
